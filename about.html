                <p>old and I’ve been drawing memory portraits for the past 11 years.
                    I live in a small village in Hampshire, UK. I spend my days working from your beautiful images and passing on
                    my skills to other budding artists.
                    Now the brief summary is out of the way, I can go into a bit more depth.</p>

                <h2>Why drawing?</h2>
                <p>As you can already guess I have always loved art and creative things in general. After a lot of struggle I was
                    finally accepted onto a college course in Graphic Design. Whilst I was fantastic at Computers and did pass, I
                    quickly realised I was missing something… Something I didn’t know I loved at the time. I missed putting pencil
                    to paper. I made a tough decision and after completing my A-Levels, I left university to pursue a career
                    in drawing. I started off my career drawing any portrait I could find from my local area. Word of mouth helped
                    me develop a small portfolio and I started building up commissions for friends and family. In 2013 I opened
                    my first business online and started my very own Etsy Shop. With absolutely no business experience whatsoever,
                    I quickly learnt what was and wasn’t acceptable to potential customers.</p>

                <h2>Selling my first drawing…</h2>
                <p>After months and months of creating new and original drawings to showcase, my shop was still sat very quietly
                    in the digital world. Until one day I sold my first drawing! And then the next day another! I was so overwhelmed
                    I couldn’t quite believe people actually wanted to pay for my art. They were small drawings at first, but I
                    was just so pleased. A few months later, I got my first corporate commission from a small hotel. This started
                    off a chain reaction of new and exciting things and I decided to finish all the old drawings I had started
                    to fill up my Etsy shop. After a while I took the big step to promote my shop on social media and quickly
                    created new pieces of work which gained me more traction online. To this day I still use Etsy as my main
                    selling platform, alongside my website, Instagram and Facebook.</p>

                <h2>Growing my business...</h2>
                <p>Since my very first drawings, I have been lucky enough to have always kept my business busy. I guess a blend
                    of luck, great customer service and a sheer love of drawing has kept me going. I still keep up my online
                    shops as well as attending markets and fairs all over the country. I also love helping new artists start
                    their own art journeys and have started teaching drawing workshops both in person and online. Now with
                    a full-time business, I am able to put so much time into my art that it has completely transformed me.
                    I have developed my own style of drawing and business. This shift has been so incredible and has made me
                    enjoy drawing even more. I’ve also been incredibly lucky to work with some of the best people in the industry,
                    both artists and clients. I feel so blessed to have met some wonderful people and artists that I am so proud
                    to call my friends and colleagues. Alongside my artwork, my other great passion is teaching. I currently
                    run a series of online workshops and tuition sessions that I fit around my busy schedule.</p>

                <h2>Going full time...</h2>
                <p>About 2 years ago I took the leap! I quit my day job and went full time with my business. It’s been the most
                    amazing decision I’ve ever made. Going full time allowed me to develop my portfolio and experiment with
                    new techniques and mediums. I’ve also started taking on more commissions than I ever could have when I
                    was part-time. Going full time has not been easy though. I have had to learn a lot about running a business
                    and dealing with a wide variety of customers. From first time buyers to experienced art collectors, I am
                    forever learning and adapting my business and techniques. One of the best things I’ve learnt is that
                    perseverance is the key to a successful business. There have been many ups and downs, but the most important
                    thing I’ve learnt is to keep moving forward. I’m so excited to see what the future holds. I love what I do
                    and I’m incredibly lucky to have such a great and supportive customer base. Once I close my laptop and pack
                    up the “working” hours, I unwind with one of my favourite things: spending time with my dog, family and
                    friends. I also enjoy helping out at the local dog shelter and drawing for fun. The two main reasons I’m
                    able to keep up with my business and social life is because of the people around me. My partner, family
                    and friends are always there to lend a hand or give me advice when I need it most. I couldn’t do any of
                    this without them. They are my rock and I owe everything to them. I’m so incredibly lucky to have this
                    life and I’m going to do my best to make them proud and keep up the good work!</p>
